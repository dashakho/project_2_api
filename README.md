## TO BE ADDRESSED IN FUTURE ITERATIONS

I would like for users to be able to view other user's facts upon request (adjust permissions).
I would like to make cards with facts more stylish. Also, I would love to add the ability to hide and show the description of the facts, so that a user can remember details by himself.

## PROBLEM SOLVING

My problem solving approach for this project involved troubleshooting errors appearing in the terminal and browser console as they arise by reviewing and restructuring existing code.
